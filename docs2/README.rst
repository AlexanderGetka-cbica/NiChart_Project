About
-----

*NiChart* is a novel AI-powered neuroimaging platform with tools for computing a dimensional chart from multi-modal MRI data. *NiChart* provides end-to-end pipelines from raw DICOM data to advanced
AI biomarkers, allowing to map a subject’s MRI images into personalized measurements, along with
reference distributions for comparison to a broader population.

The Basics
----------

The development of nichart is guided by several core principles:

 1. Enabling **near real-time image processing and analysis** through advanced methods.

 2. Facilitating the **continuous integration** of **cutting-edge methods** for extracting novel **AI biomarkers** from neuroimaging data.

 3. Ensuring robust and reliable results through **extensive data training and validation** on large and diverse training datasets.

 4. Providing user-friendly tools for **visualization and reporting**.

 5. Developing a deployment strategy that enables **easy access** for users with varying technical expertise and hardware resources.

Running NiChart
---------------

We provide both a locally installable **desktop application** and a **cloud-based application**. 

For the desktop application please see `NiChart GitHub <https://github.com/CBICA/NiChart_Project>`_.

`NiChart cloud application <https://neuroimagingchart.com/portal>`_, hosted via Amazon Web Services (AWS), deploys scalable infrastructure which hosts the *NiChart* tools as a standard web application accessible via the user’s web browser. 

The cloud and desktop applications are unified at the code level through the use of the Python library `Streamlit <https://streamlit.io>`_. Consequently, the user experience is nearly identical between the cloud and desktop applications.
