Installation
############

To install **NiChart Project** with pip, just do: ::

    $ pip install NiChart_Project

We always have our latest stable version on PyPI, so we highly suggest you to install it this way.

You can manually build the package from source by running: ::

    $ git clone https://github.com/CBICA/NiChart_Project

    $ cd NiChart_Project && python3 -m pip install -e .

We **do not** recomment installing the package directly from source as the repository is under development and this can cause crashes and bugs.
