# NiChart: Neuro-imaging Chart

NiChart is a novel AI-powered neuroimaging platform with tools for computing a dimensional chart from multi-modal MRI data. NiChart provides end-to-end pipelines from raw DICOM data to advanced
AI biomarkers, allowing to map a subject’s MRI images into personalized measurements, along with
reference distributions for comparison to a broader population.

We provide both locally deployable software and a cloud application. [NiChart cloud application](https://neuroimagingchart.com/portal), hosted via Amazon Web Services (AWS), deploys
scalable infrastructure which hosts the NiChart tools as a standard web application accessible via the user’s web browser. The cloud and desktop applications are unified at the code level through the use of the Python library [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Consequently, the user experience is nearly identical between the cloud and desktop applications.
