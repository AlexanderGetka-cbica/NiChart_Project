# NiChart: Neuro-imaging Chart

NiChart is a novel AI-powered neuroimaging platform with tools for computing a dimensional chart from multi-modal MRI data. NiChart provides end-to-end pipelines from raw DICOM data to advanced
AI biomarkers, allowing to map a subject’s MRI images into personalized measurements, along with
reference distributions for comparison to a broader population.

## The Basics:

The development of nichart is guided by several core principles:

1. Enabling **near real-time image processing and analysis** through advanced methods.

2. Enabling the **continuous integration of cutting-edge processing and analysis methods** to extract meaningful AI biomarkers from multi-modal neuroimaging data.

3. Ensuring robust and reliable results through **extensive data training and validation** on large and diverse training datasets.

4. Providing user-friendly tools for result **visualization and reporting**.

5. Developing a deployment strategy that enables **easy access for users with varying technical expertise and hardware resources**.

## Running NiChart:

We provide both a locally installable desktop application and a cloud-based application. 

For the desktop application please see our [documentation](https://cbica.github.io/NiChart_Project/) and [our GitHub page](https://github.com/CBICA/NiChart_Project/). 

[NiChart cloud application](https://neuroimagingchart.com/portal), hosted via Amazon Web Services (AWS), deploys scalable infrastructure which hosts the NiChart tools as a standard web application accessible via the user’s web browser. 

The cloud and desktop applications are unified at the code level through the use of the Python library [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Consequently, the user experience is nearly identical between the cloud and desktop applications.
